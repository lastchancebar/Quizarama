# Testing
## Code Validation
The Quizarama site has to be thoroughly tested. All the code has been run though the [W3C HTML Validator](http://validator.w3.org/), the  [W3C CSS Vaidator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) and the [JavaScript validator](https://jshint.com/). Minor error were found on the game and end pages. After a fix and retest  no errors were  returned.
 The HTML validator results for each page are below:
* Home page
