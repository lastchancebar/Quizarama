  ## Wireframes

  I did not use wireframes to plan this project.

  ## Site Structure
  
  Quizarama has 5 HTML pages. The [home page](index.html) is the default loading page, [instructions page](instructions.html), 
  [game page](game.html), [username and save score page](end.html) and [high scores page](highscores.html). The instructions, 
  game and high scores pages are accessible from the home page via button. The end page loads after the game is played.

  ## Design Choices
    *   ### Typography
*  The fonts chosen were Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif from the suggesting listing provided by Github. I tried Patrick Hand and Montserrat fonts from google fonts but settled on the fonts chosen as they were clear and familiar to the end-user and gave the quiz gravitas. They aslo provide lots of fall-back if a browser has difficult recognising the first font presented.
 * * ### Colour Scheme
    I based my colour scheme on the following image of an ancient atlas found on unsplash 
    ![Old Atlas image](assets/images/oldatlas.jpeg>). I did not uses this image as a background image as it slowed the loading 
    of the website down where I was in danger of losing the user's attention. 
    I used antique white and brown throughout with a very dark grey/ black for text.

    # Features
    Quizarama is set up to be fun challenging and easy to use. It is a typical multiple choice quiz with interactive features 
    such as save scores and high scores. The idea is to encourage the user to play and replay the game and aim to increase 
    their scores.

    ## Existing Features
    * ### Home page
  This is the default loading page and contains the name of the quiz the subject, and links to instructions, the game and high 
  scores. The buttons are prominent and clearly labelled and invite the user into the game.

      [back to top](<#contents>)

      * ### Game Page
    * ![Game page](assets/images/readme-images/qgame.png)
    *  The top left hand feature is a progress bar which tells the user the number of the question between 1-10 that they are
   attempting.
   * Top right hand feature is a score which increases by 10 points each time the user answers a question correcty. There is
   no penalty for answering a question incorrectly.
  * The middle of the page contains the geography question (taken from an API called Open Trivia Database) and the four multiple choice answers - one correct and three incorrect.
If the user selects a correct answer , the answer box colour background changes to  bright green and if incorrect, the answer
  *  box changes to bright red. Green for correct and red for incorrect is easily understood by the user.
  *  The game page automatically goes to the [ enter name and save score page](end.html) when the user has answered 10 questions.
  
      [back to top](<#contents>)

      * ### Name and save score page
  ![name and score page](assets/images/readme-images/qend.png)
  * Once the user has completed the 10 questions this page automatically loads with the users score.
  * The user is invited to enter their name and save their score.
  * The user is invited to play the game again or go back to the home page.
  * The home page contains a button for high scores which the user may check to see if they are among the top five high scorers.
  
  
      [back to top](<#contents>)
  * ### High Scores Page
  ![high Scores Page](assets/images/readme-images/qhighscores.png)
  This page is accessed by clicking the high scores button situated in the [home page](index.html). The page keeps a list of the
   names input and matching scores of the top five scorers only.
  There is a home button under the list when the user wishes to navigate away from the page.

      * Add other categories
      * Store high scores and names in a secure storage database.

# Acknowledgements

The site was completed as a Portfolio 2 Project piece for the Full Stack Software Developer (e-Commerce) Diploma at the Code Institute. As such I would like to thank my mentor Precious Ijege, the Slack community, especially Dave Horrocks and Rachel Rock, and all at the Code Institute for their help and support, especially Kasia, my course administrator. 

Finally, I would like to acknowledge the class of strong and supportive women I am lucky to be part of and Mayo Sligo Leitrim ETB for giving us the opportunity to acquire the valuable skills with which I know we will go forth and conquer the world (of computing!!)
